# <a name="coding"></a> 1. General Coding Interview (Algorithms and Data Structures) :computer: 

As an ML engineer, you're first expected to have a good understanding of general software engineering concepts, and in particular, basic algorithms and data structure.

Depending on the company and seniority level, there are usually one or two rounds of general coding interviews. The general coding interview is very similar to SW engineer coding interviews, and one can get prepared for this one same as other SW engineering roles.

## Leetcode

At this time, [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) is the most popular place to practice coding questions. I practiced with around 350 problems, which were roughly distributed as **55% Medium, 35% Easy, and 15% Hard** problems. You can find some information on the questions that I practiced in [Ma Leet Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A8GIgCIn7gvnwE-ZBymI-4-5_ZxQfyeQu99N6f5gEGk/edit#gid=656844248) - Yea I tried to have a little bit fun with it here and there to make the pain easier to carry :D (I will write on my approach to leetcode in the future.)


# <a name="ml-coding"></a> 2. ML/Data Coding
ML coding module may or may not exist in particular companies interviews. The good news is that, there are a limited number of ML algorithms that candidates are expected to be able to code. The most common ones include:
- k-means clustering
- k-nearest neighbors
- Decision trees
- Perceptron, MLP
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- SVM
- Sampling
  - stratified sampling
  - uniform sampling
  - reservoir sampling
  - sampling multinomial distribution
  - random generator
- NLP algorithms (if that's your area of work)
  - bigrams
  - tf-idf


# <a name="breadth"></a> 4. ML Breadth/Fundamentals
As the name suggests, this interview is intended to evaluate your general knowledge of ML concepts both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Unlike ML depth interviews, the breadth interviews tend to follow a pretty similar structure and coverage amongst different interviewers and interviewees.

The best way to prepare for this interview is to review your notes from ML courses as well some high quality online courses and material. In particular, I found the following resources pretty helpful.

## Courses and review material:
- [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (you can also find the [lectures on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN) )
- [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects)
- [Udacity's deep learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) or  [Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (for deep learning)


If you already know the concepts, the following resources are pretty useful for a quick review of different concepts:
- [StatQuest Machine Learning videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)
- [StatQuest Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBigTkBLU6g&list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9) (for statistics review - most useful for Data Science roles)
- [Machine Learning cheatsheets](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Chris Albon's ML falshcards](https://machinelearningflashcards.com/)

Below are the most important topics to cover:
## 1. Classic ML Concepts

### ML Algorithms' Categories
  - Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning (with examples)
    - Classification vs regression vs clustering
  - Parametric vs non-parametric algorithms
    - Examples of parametric algorithms (model form is fixed, find coefficients):
      - Regression
      - Logistic regression
      - Linear Discriminant Analysis
    - Examples of non-parametric algorithms:
      - Support Vector Machines
      - Decision Trees
  - Linear vs Nonlinear algorithms
### Supervised learning
  - Linear Algorithms
    - Linear regression
      - Least squares, residuals, linear vs multivariate regression
    - Logistic regression
      - Cost function (equation, code), sigmoid function, cross entropy
        - What is the difference between $L_1$ (Lasso) and $L_2$ (Ridge) regularization?
          - $$\text{L1 cost} = \sum_{i=0}^{N}(y_i - \sum_{j=0}^{M}x_{ij}W_j)^2 + \lambda\sum_{j=0}^{M}\left\vert{W_j}\right\vert$$
          - $$\text{L2 cost} = \sum_{i=0}^{N}(y_i - \sum_{j=0}^{M}x_{ij}W_j)^2 + \lambda\sum_{j=0}^{M}W_j^2$$
          - $L_1$ uses the absolute of the weights $W_j$ whereas $L_2$ uses the squared value of $W_j$.
          - $L_1$ estimates **median** of the data whereas $L_2$ estimates **mean**.
          - From gradient descent POV, $L_1$ will constantly penalize until $W=0$, whereas $L_2$ decreasing gradient will penalize less and less approaching 0.
          - $L_1$ regularization in feature selection helps to eliminate unimportant features due to its sparse estimates nature.
      - Binary cross-entropy = Cross-entropy with $C = 2$.
        - $$\text{CE} = - \sum_{t}^{C}t_i\log(s_i) \\
        \text{BCE} = - \sum_{t=1}^{C=2}t_i\log(s_i) = -t_1\log(s_1) - t_2\log(s_2) $$
        - Substitute $t_2 = 1 - t_1, s_2 = 1 - s_1$
        - $$\text{BCE} = -t_1\log(s_1) - (1-t_1)\log(1-s_1)$$
    - Support Vector Machines
      - Hard margin, term used when data is **linearly** separable.
        - $\text{Margin distance} = \frac{2}{\left\Vert w \right\Vert}$
        - $\min_{w} \left\Vert{w}\right\Vert^2$ subject to $y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1$ for $i = 1\dots N$
      - Soft margin, term used when data is **not linearly** separable.
        - *Hinge loss* function is used: $\max(0, 1-y_i(w^Tx_i - b))$, where $y_i$ is the raw output of the classifier i.e. probability.
        - Goal is to minimize: $$\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}{N}\max(0, 1-y_i(w^Tx_i - b))\right] + \lambda\left\Vert w \right\Vert^2$$
    - Linear discriminant analysis

  - Decision Trees
    - Logits
    - Leaves
    - Training algorithm
      - stop criteria
    - Inference
    - Pruning

  - Ensemble methods
    - Bagging and boosting methods (with examples)
    - Random Forest
      - Ensemble?
      - *Classification*: Each decision tree is allowed a vote and the class with the most votes is the prediction.
      - *Regression*: Each decision tree generates an individual prediction and the average is taken as the final prediction.
      - **Uncorrelatedness** is important for random forests else it is as good as a single decision tree.
      - Methods to decorrelate trees i.e. **RANDOM** part of **RANDOM** Forests:
        - **[Subset of rows]** Bootstrap aggregating / Bagging: Each tree gets to sample a subset of the training data with replacement, where some examples are repeated. Then the output is combined through a process called "bootstrap aggregating" or "bagging".
        - **[Subset of columns]** Feature randomness: Each tree gets to see a subset of the features for training.

    - Boosting
      - Adaboost
      - GBM
      - XGBoost
        - What is XGBoost?
          - Speed and performance through parallelization
          - Differs from Random Forest by how the individual trees are built and in the way the results are combined.
          - Boosting?
            - Combines weak learners sequentially, each new tree corrects the errors of the previous one.
            - $F(2) = F(1) + \eta \cdot \text{Second tree}$ 
            where $\text{Second tree} = - \frac{\partial L}{\partial F(1)} = - \frac{\partial \text{Loss function}}{\partial \text{Previous model's output}}$
        - | Parameters | Description |
          | :--- | :--- |
          | alpha $\alpha$ | $L_1$ regularization |
          | lambda $\lambda$ | $L_2$ regularization |
          | gamma $\gamma$ | Minimum loss reduction to make further parition on a leaf node |
          | eta $\eta$ | Learning rate |
          | max_depth | Maximum depth of the tree, increasing this will increases model complexity and tendency to overfit |
          | subsample | Range (0, 1] subsamples training data prior to growing trees, prevents overfitting |

# <a name="ml-sys"></a>  5. Machine Learning System Design

## Designing ML systems for production
This is one of my favorite interviews in which you can shine bright and up-level your career. I'd like to mention the following important notes:

- Remember, the goal of ML system design interview is NOT to measure your deep and detailed knowledge of different ML algorithms, but your ability to zoom out and design a production-level ML system that can be deployed as a service within a company's ML infrastructure.

- Deploying deep learning models in production can be challenging, and it is beyond training models with good performance. Several distinct components need to be designed and developed in order to deploy a production level deep learning system.
<p align="center">
